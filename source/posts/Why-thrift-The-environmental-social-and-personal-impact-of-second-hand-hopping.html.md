I began thrift-store shopping about the same time I began buying my own clothes.
The inexpensive, one-of-a-kind gems I discovered by scrounging through piles of
dusty garments made the whole endeavor seem more like a real treasure hunt than
any of the simulations computer games offered. I’ve been hooked ever since.

Thrifting has become such a way of life for me that I sometimes forget there are
people who have yet to succumb to its charms. But since I claimed thrifting as
the most morally responsible mode of shopping in a recent post, it seems fitting
to outline why I believe this is true.

## Why Thrift

### Environmental Impact

**Re-wearing clothes reduces waste and pollution.** Every garment purchased
second-hand means one less new one produced, which is important because
regardless of material, the production of clothing is costly to the environment.
Producing synthetic fibers like polyester requires lots of energy, as well as
crude oil like petroleum; byproducts include toxic gases and chemicals. Sadly,
pesticides used on most plants mean that even cotton and linen garments have a
negative impact. Transportation-related pollution also decreases when clothing
is re-used, as new clothes are much more likely to travel long distances before
being sold than are their second-hand counterparts.

**Second-hand clothes are less likely to end up in landfills.** In order to
survive its first wearer in decent enough condition to make it into your hands,
there’s a good chance your thrifted item is pretty hardy. And every item that
doesn’t break/rip/unravel once you take it home means one less item in your
trashcan.

### Social Impact

Thrift stores make it easier to know where your money is going. To track the
money you handed over for that brand-new Old Navy polo, you would need to trace
the brand back to the corporation behind it, the assembly factories used by the
corporation, their textile providers, and those textile providers’ raw materials
suppliers—at a bare minimum. In evaluating all these steps (and the many others
involved in the production chain), there are numerous considerations to keep
in mind: Was your farmer using environmentally responsible methods? Was your
seamstress of legal working age, paid a fair wage to work in a safe factory? Is
the corporation behind it the kind you want to support, or one whose views you
wouldn’t like to see perpetuated?

In short, it can be a bit of a nightmare to track the impact of your seemingly
trivial purchase. However, with most thrift stores, this burden is greatly
reduced. For better or worse, the original purchaser’s money has already
supported the whole chain of production that led to your second-hand Old Navy
polo.* Since most thrift stores in Europe, North America, and Australia rely
heavily (if not exclusively) on donated clothing, this means you only have to
question one link in the whole chain—the store right in front of you.

\*Personally, I feel no qualms about buying second-hand from brands I’d avoid
otherwise, since none of my money will end up oiling their machine. Still,
there’s no sense in abstaining from firsthand Nike purchases if you’re going to
serve as a walking billboard by wearing their logo everywhere you go.

Many thrift stores directly support charity. It’s no coincidence that in
Ireland, the term “thrift store” doesn’t even exist—they call them “charity
shops” instead. In America, the best-known thrift stores are Goodwill and The
Salvation Army, organizations which provide services to the unemployed,
homeless, and disabled. In Europe, NGOs like Oxfam commonly use thrift stores to
raise funds for humanitarian aid. By shopping at these kinds of establishments,
your clothing purchase can go from supporting Third World child labor to
supporting Third World childrens’ education.

### Personal Impact

**Thrifting is cheaper.** One of my all-time favorite dresses that I wore for
years cost less than $1. Do I really need to explain to you why more money in
your own pocket is a good thing?

**Secondhand clothing is often higher quality than comparatively-priced
clothing.** As mentioned in the environment section, this means you’re
contributing less to landfills—but it also means less frustration over incidents
like your brand-new shoe breaking the first time you wear it. (This actually
happened to me with some Urban Outfitters platforms. I was not impressed).

**Thrifted clothing offers more room for uniqueness.** While it’s not the end
of the world to see some other guy sporting the same sweater as you, most of us
would choose to avoid such incidents, if possible. Since thrifted clothing
infrequently comes in multiples, you’re much less likely to bump into someone
wearing the exact same thing. In addition, there’s bound to be lots of clothes
that were produced decades ago, or on the other side of the country, or in some
other circumstance that makes them different than what the average shopper is
buying off the sale rack at the mall.

**Thrift shopping allows for more creativity.** Thrift stores are notorious for
the wacky and bizarre items they often contain. (Remember Macklemore’s footed
Batman jammies?) While these items can be downright eyesores, many just need
a person with vision to re-interpret them in a contemporary way. For some,
this may mean simply adding the right accessories; others may completely
reconstruct their garment with shears and a trusty Singer. Either way,
thrifting can allow one to do more than mindlessly mimic what one sees on the
display-window mannequin, by providing more varied and interesting materials as
inspiration.

In short, thrifting is more environmentally and socially responsible, and
personally rewarding. What are you waiting for?
